# LMS Application
 This is an iOS Learning Management System (LMS) application developed using UIKit and Swift. The app allows students to participate in online and offline classes, view recorded lectures, take exams, and review their results. Teachers can manage courses, upload lectures, and track student progress. The project uses the MVVM architecture, integrates the Jitsi Meet SDK for video conferencing, and PostgreSQL for the database.
